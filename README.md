**Notes from the dev** 
 
This application was built under a time crunch, and as such, there may be some liberties taken. While it has been endeavoured to produce a functional and performant app, I applied a pragmatic approach to prioritise key features that were explicitly defined in the requirements. Normally, I would prefer to apply a much more modular approach, but in the interests of speed, there are some functions or components that were grouped together, and appropriate unit testing was not fully built out (there is, however, an example test file included). Enjoy!
